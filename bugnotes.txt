* Initializing a network exactly at its equilibrium position (all extents = RLS) causes position evaluation to be all NaNs

It seems to be okay if the Free State sets the network at its eq. position. In this case there is some rounding error


* Over-constraining the network (all degrees of freedom specified) causes position evaluation to be all NaNs
